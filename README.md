# dh2321-project1

Project was developed in Python3 using Plotly Dash library and Pandas, it also utilises TailwindCSS for styling through an external script. This project was made for the assignment "Individual Project 1" for the course DH2321 - Informationa Visualisation from KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Raw data used in this project was collected from a survey conducted within the course distributed for all enrolled students, their identities have been anonymised and are represented as aliases instead.

To run the code on your local machine, ensure you install the proper dependencies through the "requirements.txt" file. Then, simply run "python Individual_Project1" in your terminal to run the programme.
